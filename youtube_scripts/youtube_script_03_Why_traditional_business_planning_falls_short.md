Picture this: You've got a brilliant startup idea, you've spent weeks crafting the perfect business plan, and you're ready to take on the world. But what if I told you that traditional business planning could be setting you up for failure? I'm Simon Wardley, and in this video, we're going to explore why the old ways of business planning fall short for startups, and introduce a powerful alternative: Wardley Mapping.

Traditional business planning was developed in an era of relative stability. But startups? They operate in a world of high uncertainty, rapid technological change, and evolving customer needs. It's like trying to navigate a speedboat with a map designed for a cruise ship. Let's break down why this mismatch causes problems.

Traditional business planning suffers from five major shortcomings when applied to startups. First, inflexibility in the face of rapid change. Second, over-reliance on untested assumptions. Third, failure to account for ecosystem dynamics. Fourth, inadequate consideration of technological evolution. And fifth, limited ability to identify and leverage emerging opportunities. Let's dive deeper into each of these.

One of the most dangerous aspects of traditional planning is what I call the 'false precision trap'. Startups often make detailed projections based on limited data, creating an illusion of certainty. Remember, it's far more valuable to be roughly right than precisely wrong. Let me share a quick anecdote from my experience advising a govtech startup...
