Welcome, innovators and disruptors! Today, we're diving into a game-changing strategy that could revolutionize your startup: creating new markets through value chain reconfiguration. I'm [Your Name], and in this video, we'll explore how Wardley Mapping can help you identify and leverage opportunities that even industry giants might have missed. Are you ready to reshape entire industries? Let's get started!

So, what exactly is value chain reconfiguration? Imagine taking apart a complex machine, rearranging its components, and reassembling it to perform an entirely new function. That's essentially what we're doing with value chains. We're reimagining how value is created, delivered, and captured in an industry. And the best part? This approach is particularly powerful in sectors ripe for disruption, like government and public services.

Think about an industry you're familiar with. Can you visualize its current value chain? Now, imagine how you might rearrange it to create more value or reach new markets.

Now, here's where Wardley Mapping comes in as our secret weapon. It's like having a strategic X-ray of the industry. First, we create a detailed map of the current value chain, including all key components and their evolutionary stages. Then, we analyze this map to spot inefficiencies, pain points, and emerging technologies that could enable new configurations. Let's look at an example.

Can you spot any inefficiencies or opportunities in this map?

One powerful approach to reconfiguration is through disintermediation - removing unnecessary middlemen - or re-intermediation - introducing new, value-adding intermediaries. For instance, in the government sector, digital platforms have been game-changers, allowing citizens to interact directly with public services. But it's not just about cutting out middlemen; it's about reimagining the entire interaction.

What government services do you think could benefit from this approach?

Now, let's talk about the ultimate form of value chain reconfiguration: creating platform ecosystems. This is where things get really exciting. By using Wardley Mapping, we can identify components that could serve as foundations for broader ecosystems. Think of concepts like 'government-as-a-platform', where core services become a launchpad for third-party innovation. It's not just reconfiguring; it's creating an entirely new playing field!

Imagine you're creating a platform in your industry. What would be its core component?

And there you have it, innovators! We've explored how Wardley Mapping can be your guide to reconfiguring value chains and creating new markets. Remember, the key is to remain adaptable. Your initial map is a hypothesis; be prepared to redraw it as you learn and as the market evolves. Now, it's your turn to start mapping and reconfiguring. What industry will you disrupt? What new market will you create? The possibilities are endless!
