## Full Script

Welcome to our series on Wardley Mapping for Startups! Today, we're diving into a game-changing strategy: leveraging emerging technologies and practices, especially in the government and public sector. Imagine having a crystal ball that not only shows you the future but also how to get there. That's the power of Wardley Mapping when it comes to emerging tech. Ready to unlock this superpower? Let's get started!

In Wardley Maps, emerging technologies and practices are found in the 'genesis' and 'custom-built' stages of the evolution axis. These are the components with the highest potential for disruption and value creation, but they also come with higher risks. By mapping these elements, startups can visualize their impact on the entire value chain and develop strategies to harness their power effectively. Can you think of an emerging technology in your field? Where would you place it on this map?

One of the key advantages of Wardley Mapping is its ability to provide a visual representation of the entire landscape. This holistic view allows startups to identify potential synergies, dependencies, and opportunities that might otherwise be overlooked. Let's look at an example: imagine a government-focused startup identifying blockchain technology for secure data sharing between agencies. By mapping this alongside existing components, they can visualize how it integrates with and enhances current processes, potentially leading to a disruptive new service. What other technologies could potentially disrupt government processes?

When leveraging emerging technologies, it's crucial to consider their position on the evolution axis and potential movement. 'Genesis' stage tech may offer groundbreaking possibilities but require significant investment and carry higher risks. Practices moving towards 'product' or 'commodity' stages may be more stable but offer less competitive advantage. Startups must carefully balance these factors. For example, a startup improving public service delivery might identify machine learning as high potential. By mapping it, they might realize it's moving from 'custom-built' to 'product', informing their strategy to focus on unique government-specific applications. How would you balance the risk and potential reward in your startup?

The government and public sector present unique challenges and opportunities. These sectors often have specific regulatory requirements, longer decision-making processes, and extensive security needs. Startups must factor these into their Wardley Maps. For instance, a new cloud computing solution might need to be mapped alongside existing data protection regulations and government IT infrastructure to understand its viability and impact fully. What unique challenges do you think startups face in the public sector?

Leveraging emerging technologies and practices is crucial for startups driving disruptive innovation, especially in the government and public sector. Wardley Mapping provides a powerful framework for identifying, analyzing, and strategically incorporating these elements. By visualizing the landscape, understanding evolutionary trajectories, and mapping interdependencies, startups can make informed decisions for maximum impact. Remember, in the public sector, it's about finding the right balance between innovation and compliance. Wardley Mapping helps navigate this complex landscape with confidence. So, are you ready to start mapping your path to disruptive innovation?

Next time, we'll explore how to use Wardley Mapping for scenario planning in uncertain environments. Don't miss it!
