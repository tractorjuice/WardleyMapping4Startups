Welcome to our series on Wardley Mapping for Startups! Today, we're diving into a powerful technique that can revolutionize your decision-making process: using multiple Wardley Maps. Whether you're a startup founder, a product manager, or just curious about strategic planning, this video will show you how to gain a 360-degree view of your business landscape. Ready to make smarter, more informed decisions? Let's get mapping!

Multi-Map Analysis is like having multiple strategic lenses to view your business through. Instead of relying on a single Wardley Map, we create several maps, each offering a unique perspective. This approach is particularly valuable for startups in complex environments, like the public sector, where decisions can have far-reaching consequences.

Think about a recent big decision you made. How many different perspectives did you consider?

One of the most powerful applications of multi-map analysis is scenario planning. By creating maps for different possible futures, you can prepare for uncertainty and develop more resilient strategies. Let's take a govtech startup as an example. They might create separate maps for scenarios like 'increased government digitization', 'budget cuts', and 'changes in data privacy regulations'.

What potential future scenarios keep you up at night? How could mapping them out help you sleep better?

When faced with critical decisions, creating a Wardley Map for each option can provide clarity. Imagine a startup deciding between developing proprietary technology or leveraging existing open-source solutions. By mapping both approaches, they can visualize the different value chains, dependencies, and evolutionary characteristics of each option.

What's a big strategic decision your startup is facing right now? How could mapping out your options help?

In the public sector, considering multiple stakeholder perspectives is crucial. Create separate maps from the viewpoints of different stakeholders - government agencies, citizens, partner organizations. Additionally, time-based mapping allows you to visualize your strategic journey across different time horizons.

Who are the key stakeholders in your ecosystem? How might their perspectives differ from yours?

Once you've created multiple maps, the magic happens in comparing them. Techniques like overlay analysis, gap analysis, and opportunity spotting can reveal insights that aren't visible in individual maps. Remember, the goal isn't just to create multiple maps, but to use them as tools for deeper analysis and more informed decision-making.

What patterns or insights might emerge if you overlaid your different strategic maps?

And there you have it! Multi-map analysis is a powerful tool in your strategic arsenal. By considering multiple scenarios, perspectives, and options, you can make more robust decisions and develop strategies that are resilient in the face of uncertainty. Remember, it's not about predicting the future, but about being prepared for multiple futures. So, are you ready to start mapping your way to better decisions?

Next time, we'll explore how to use Wardley Mapping for competitive analysis. Don't miss it!
