# Key Steps in the Iteration Process

1. Analysing your current map
2. Identifying areas for improvement or innovation
3. Generating hypotheses for business model changes
4. Testing and validating these hypotheses
5. Updating your map and business model accordingly

# Step 1: Analysing Your Current Map

- Examine component positioning along evolution axis
- Understand dependencies between components
- Identify gaps or inefficiencies in value chain

> "The power of Wardley Mapping lies not just in creating the map, but in the insights that emerge when you truly scrutinise it." - Government Strategist

# Step 4: Testing and Validating Hypotheses

- Use Lean Startup principles
- Implement Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)
- Conduct A/B testing and customer interviews

Example: Public transportation startup testing real-time traffic data integration

# Step 5: Updating Map and Business Model

- Adjust component positions
- Add or remove components
- Change relationships between components
- Update value proposition or customer segments
- Modify revenue streams or cost structure
