## A Wardley Mapping Approach for Startups

---

# Introduction

- Crucial for driving disruptive innovation in startups
- Particularly important in government and public sector contexts
- Wardley Mapping: A powerful framework for identifying and capitalizing on opportunities

---

# Understanding Emerging Technologies

- Represent 'genesis' and 'custom-built' stages in Wardley Maps
- High potential for disruption and value creation
- Carry higher risks and uncertainties

---

# Wardley Mapping Process

1. Identify relevant emerging technologies and practices
2. Map elements to understand position and potential evolution
3. Analyze interactions within the value chain
4. Develop strategies for incorporation
5. Regularly monitor and reassess
