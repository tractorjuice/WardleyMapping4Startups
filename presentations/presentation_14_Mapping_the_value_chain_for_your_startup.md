# Mapping the Value Chain for Your Startup

---

# Why Map Your Value Chain?

- Visualize components delivering value to users
- Reveal strategic insights and opportunities
- Align strategy with user needs
- Navigate uncertainty and drive innovation

---

# 5 Key Steps to Map Your Value Chain

1. Identify users and their needs
2. List components meeting those needs
3. Determine dependencies between components
4. Position components on the evolution axis
5. Analyze the resulting map for insights

---

# Step 1: Identify Users and Their Needs

- Dig deep to understand true motivations and pain points
- Look beyond surface-level wants
- Example: "Easy access to personalized information" vs. "Faster website"

> "Understanding user needs is not just about what they say they want, but about uncovering the underlying problems they're trying to solve."

---

# Step 2: List Components

Categories to consider:
- User-facing services
- Business processes
- Data and information
- Technology and infrastructure

Example components:
- Mobile app
- User authentication
- Data analytics
- Cloud hosting
- Privacy compliance framework

---

# Step 3: Determine Dependencies

- Reveal the underlying structure of your value chain
- Uncover hidden dependencies with strategic implications
- Understand the flow of value and potential vulnerabilities

> "Mapping dependencies isn't just about drawing lines between boxes. It's about understanding the flow of value and the potential points of leverage or vulnerability in your startup's ecosystem."

---

# Step 4: Position on Evolution Axis

Consider:
- How well understood is the component?
- Level of uncertainty in building/using it
- Availability of vendors/alternatives
- Trend towards standardization/commoditization

Insights: Identify areas for innovation vs. potential risks

---

# Step 5: Analyze for Insights

Look for:
- Clusters representing core capabilities
- Critical but highly evolved components (potential risks)
- Novel components (potential competitive advantages)
- Gaps or inefficiencies in the value chain
- Key external dependencies

> "The true value of a Wardley Map isn't in its creation, but in the strategic conversations and decisions it enables."

# Example: Government Startup Insight

Through mapping and analysis, a government startup discovered:

- Unique capability in data integration
- More novel than initially realized
- Led to strategy pivot
- Resulted in significant growth and impact in public sector

---

# Summary

- Mapping your startup's value chain is crucial for strategic decision-making
- Follow the 5-step process to create your Wardley Map
- Regularly update your map as your startup evolves
- Use the map to communicate strategy, align teams, and identify innovation opportunities
- Remember: It's a tool for thinking, not just documentation
