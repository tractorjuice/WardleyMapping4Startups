# Using Maps to Inform Hypothesis Generation and Testing

---

# The Power of Synergy

- Wardley Mapping + Lean Startup
- Enhanced precision and efficiency in innovation
- Strategic context for hypothesis-driven approach

---

# Wardley Mapping's Contribution

- Visual representation of value chain and competitive landscape
- Provides strategic context often missing in traditional Lean Startup
- Considers broader ecosystem, not just immediate customer needs

---

# Enhancing the Hypothesis Testing Process

1. Hypothesis Generation
2. Hypothesis Prioritisation
3. Experiment Design
4. Results Interpretation

---

# Uncovering Hidden Assumptions

- Wardley Maps bring unconscious biases to the surface
- Makes assumptions explicit and testable
- Example: Challenging assumptions about component evolution

> "We've uncovered assumptions we didn't even know we were making, which has been absolutely crucial for our success."

---

# Anticipating Future Scenarios

- Map potential future states of market and value chain
- Generate hypotheses about upcoming challenges and opportunities
- Enables proactive strategy development
- Provides competitive advantage

---

# Iterative Process

- Regularly update maps with new insights
- Continuous refinement of strategic context
- Leads to increasingly targeted and effective hypothesis testing over time

---

# Practical Implementation

1. Create initial Wardley Map
2. Identify key areas of uncertainty/opportunity
3. Generate hypotheses
4. Prioritise hypotheses
5. Design experiments
6. Conduct experiments and analyse results
7. Update Wardley Map and repeat

# Benefits Beyond Startups

- Valuable in public sector and government contexts
- Enables more effective policy development and service delivery

> "It's allowed us to test policy hypotheses with a level of strategic insight we've never had before, leading to more effective and citizen-centric services."

# Summary

- Wardley Mapping + Lean Startup = Powerful toolkit for navigating uncertainty
- Provides strategic context to experimentation process
- Enables more informed decisions and anticipation of future challenges
- Increases chances of success in dynamic, competitive markets
