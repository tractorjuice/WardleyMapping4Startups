## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world scenario of a startup facing strategic challenges. Introduce the concept of component evolution and dependencies in Wardley Mapping.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in a group discussion about the startup's challenges and brainstorm potential components in its value chain.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, whiteboard for brainstorming

**Differentiation:** Provide visual aids and written summaries for diverse learning styles

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software to gather initial thoughts on component evolution

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through the process of identifying components and their current evolutionary stages using a sample Wardley Map.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, create a draft Wardley Map for the case study startup, focusing on identifying components and their evolutionary stages.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping software, case study materials

**Differentiation:** Provide additional guidance and simplified examples for novice learners

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative mapping software for group work

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Explain the concepts of component evolution rates and dependencies. Demonstrate how to analyze these aspects using the sample Wardley Map.

**Learner Activities:** Annotate their draft Wardley Maps with evolution rates and dependencies. Participate in a guided discussion on the implications of these factors.

**Resources Used:** Annotated sample Wardley Map, presentation slides

**Differentiation:** Offer one-on-one support for learners struggling with complex concepts

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing to demonstrate analysis techniques in real-time

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a workshop on projecting future states and developing strategic options based on component evolution and dependencies.

**Learner Activities:** In groups, project future states of their Wardley Maps and develop strategic recommendations for the case study startup.

**Resources Used:** Worksheets for future state projection, strategy development templates

**Differentiation:** Provide additional prompts and examples for less experienced strategists

**Technology Integration:** Use virtual breakout rooms for group discussions and collaborative work

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a reflection process on their learning and its application to their own professional contexts.

**Learner Activities:** Complete a self-assessment questionnaire and participate in a brief peer review of strategic recommendations.

**Resources Used:** Self-assessment questionnaire, peer review rubric

**Differentiation:** Offer alternative assessment methods (e.g., oral presentation) for diverse learners

**Technology Integration:** Use online forms for self-assessment and peer review submissions

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group work and discussions throughout the lesson
  - Alignment: Assesses learners' ability to apply concepts in real-time, aligning with the practical nature of professional work
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final Wardley Maps and strategic recommendations
  - Alignment: Assesses learners' ability to synthesize learning into actionable business strategies, directly applicable to their professional roles

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice strategists**: Provide simplified templates, additional guidance, and more structured activities
* **Experienced professionals**: Offer more complex case studies and encourage deeper analysis of industry-specific factors

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Technology management
* Market research
* Product development
* Financial planning

## Real-World Applications
* Strategic planning for startups
* Innovation management in established companies
* Technology investment decisions
* Competitive analysis and positioning

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on personal biases in strategic thinking
* Analysis of own company's value chain and component evolution
* Consideration of how Wardley Mapping changes individual approach to strategy

## Extension Activities
* Apply Wardley Mapping to learner's own business or project
* Conduct a mini-research project on component evolution in a specific industry
* Create a presentation on strategic recommendations for a real startup based on Wardley Mapping analysis

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure confidentiality when discussing real business strategies
* Remind learners of ethical considerations in strategic planning and competitive analysis

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How does understanding component evolution change your view of your business or industry?
* What challenges do you anticipate in applying Wardley Mapping to your work?
* How might this approach to strategy affect your decision-making process?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did learners grasp the concept of component evolution?
* What aspects of the lesson seemed most challenging for learners?
* How can the lesson be improved to better meet the needs of diverse professional learners?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use virtual whiteboard tools for collaborative mapping exercises
* Implement breakout rooms for small group discussions and activities
* Utilize asynchronous discussion forums for extended reflection and peer feedback

## Additional Resources
* Simon Wardley's blog on Wardley Mapping
* Online Wardley Mapping tools and communities
* Case studies of successful strategy implementation using Wardley Maps
* Industry reports on technology evolution and market trends
