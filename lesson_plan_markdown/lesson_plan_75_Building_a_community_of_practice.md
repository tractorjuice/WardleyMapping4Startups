## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world startup scenario where lack of strategic alignment led to challenges. Introduce the concept of Wardley Mapping and its potential impact on strategic decision-making.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in a group discussion about personal experiences with strategic misalignment in their startups. Brainstorm potential benefits of a more structured approach to strategy.

**Resources Used:** Slide deck with case study, interactive polling tool

**Differentiation:** Provide multiple examples from different industries to cater to diverse startup backgrounds

**Technology Integration:** Use an online polling tool to gather and display participant responses in real-time

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide participants through the key components of building a Wardley Mapping community of practice. Facilitate small group discussions on each component.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, explore and discuss one assigned component of building a CoP (e.g., identifying champions, establishing goals, creating knowledge-sharing platforms). Create a mini-presentation on their assigned topic.

**Resources Used:** Handouts on CoP components, digital collaboration spaces

**Differentiation:** Assign groups based on experience levels, ensuring a mix of novice and experienced professionals in each group

**Technology Integration:** Use breakout rooms in virtual settings, and collaborative documents for group work

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate group presentations on CoP components. Provide additional context and real-world examples for each component. Introduce a sample Wardley Map for a CoP implementation.

**Learner Activities:** Present findings from group discussions. Engage in Q&A sessions after each presentation. Analyze the sample Wardley Map for CoP implementation.

**Resources Used:** Sample Wardley Map, presentation tools

**Differentiation:** Offer additional resources for deeper exploration of specific components based on learner interests

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing for presentations and interactive Wardley Mapping tools for demonstration

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 75 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a complex startup scenario requiring strategic decision-making. Guide participants in applying Wardley Mapping techniques to the scenario. Facilitate the creation of a CoP implementation plan.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to create a Wardley Map for the given scenario. Develop a comprehensive plan for implementing a Wardley Mapping CoP in their startup, addressing all key components discussed earlier.

**Resources Used:** Scenario description, Wardley Mapping templates, planning worksheets

**Differentiation:** Provide additional coaching to teams as needed. Offer advanced challenges for experienced participants.

**Technology Integration:** Use online Wardley Mapping tools and collaborative planning platforms

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate team presentations of their CoP implementation plans. Guide a reflective discussion on the potential impact of Wardley Mapping CoPs on startup innovation and strategy.

**Learner Activities:** Present CoP implementation plans. Provide peer feedback. Reflect on the applicability of Wardley Mapping CoPs to their own startups.

**Resources Used:** Rubric for evaluating implementation plans, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Encourage teams to highlight unique aspects of their plans based on their startup's specific context

**Technology Integration:** Use digital feedback tools for peer and facilitator evaluations

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and activities throughout the session
  - Alignment: Assesses participants' engagement and understanding of key concepts in real-time
* **Summative**: Evaluation of the final CoP implementation plan
  - Alignment: Assesses participants' ability to apply learned concepts to a realistic startup scenario
* **Summative**: Self and peer assessment of contributions to group work
  - Alignment: Encourages reflection on collaborative skills essential in professional settings

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional resources on Wardley Mapping basics. Pair with more experienced participants during group activities.
* **Experienced professionals**: Offer advanced scenarios and challenges. Encourage them to share real-world experiences and mentor others.
* **Industry-specific needs**: Tailor examples and scenarios to specific industries represented in the participant group.

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project Management: Discuss how Wardley Mapping CoPs can enhance project planning and execution
