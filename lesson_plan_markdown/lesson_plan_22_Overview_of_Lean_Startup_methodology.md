## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world business challenge that requires both strategic foresight and rapid experimentation. Facilitate a brief discussion on current approaches to solving such challenges.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in group discussion, sharing experiences and initial thoughts on addressing the presented challenge.

**Resources Used:** Slide presentation with case study, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide multiple examples from different industries to cater to diverse professional backgrounds

**Technology Integration:** Use an interactive polling tool to gather initial thoughts and display results in real-time

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide participants through a brief overview of Wardley Mapping and Lean Startup principles separately. Facilitate small group activities to apply each methodology to the initial case study.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, create a basic Wardley Map for the case study. Then, outline a Lean Startup approach for the same scenario.

**Resources Used:** Handouts on Wardley Mapping and Lean Startup basics, worksheets for group activities

**Differentiation:** Provide additional support materials for those less familiar with either methodology

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online mapping tools for group work

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present the synergies between Wardley Mapping and Lean Startup, using examples from the content. Facilitate a whole-group discussion on how these synergies address limitations of each approach individually.

**Learner Activities:** Engage in discussion, asking questions and sharing insights on how the combined approach could benefit their specific professional contexts.

**Resources Used:** Slide presentation on synergies, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Use a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic elements in the presentation to cater to different learning styles

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital whiteboard for collaborative note-taking during discussion

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a new, more complex business scenario. Guide participants in applying the combined Wardley Mapping and Lean Startup approach to this scenario.

**Learner Activities:** In pairs or small groups, develop a strategic plan that integrates Wardley Mapping insights with Lean Startup experimentation for the new scenario.

**Resources Used:** Complex case study materials, strategic planning templates

**Differentiation:** Offer different levels of complexity in the scenarios to challenge learners at various expertise levels

**Technology Integration:** Use project management software to outline and share strategic plans

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate group presentations of strategic plans. Guide peer feedback and discussion on the effectiveness of the integrated approach.

**Learner Activities:** Present strategic plans, provide constructive feedback to peers, reflect on the learning process and potential applications in their own work.

**Resources Used:** Rubric for peer evaluation, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Allow for various presentation formats (e.g., verbal, visual, written) to accommodate different strengths

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital feedback tool for real-time peer evaluations

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and activities throughout the lesson
  - Alignment: Assesses ongoing understanding and application of concepts in a collaborative setting
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final strategic plans developed in the Elaborate phase
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to synthesize and apply the integrated approach to a complex business scenario
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on how to apply the integrated approach in their specific professional context
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to transfer learning to real-world situations and demonstrate critical thinking

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional background materials on basic concepts, offer more structured templates for activities
* **Experienced professionals**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage them to draw from their own experiences to enrich discussions
* **Public sector professionals**: Use government-specific examples and case studies, discuss unique challenges in applying these methods in public sector contexts

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project management
* Data analysis and visualization
* Public policy and governance
* Technology and innovation management

## Real-World Applications
* Developing and launching new products or services
* Navigating market disruptions and technological changes
* Improving public sector service delivery and policy implementation
* Optimizing resource allocation in resource-constrained environments

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on how the integrated approach challenges or enhances existing mental models of strategy and innovation
* Discussion on how personal biases might influence the application of these methodologies
* Self-assessment of strengths and areas for improvement in strategic thinking and experimentation

## Extension Activities
* Develop a Wardley Map and Lean Startup plan for a real project in the learner's organization
* Conduct a mini-experiment based on insights from the integrated approach and report back on results
* Create a presentation for colleagues on how to implement the integrated approach in their team or department

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure confidentiality when discussing real business challenges or strategies
* Address potential ethical considerations in data collection and experimentation, especially in public sector contexts

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How does the integrated approach of Wardley Mapping and Lean Startup challenge your current way of thinking about strategy and innovation?
* What specific aspects of this approach do you think will be most valuable in your professional context, and why?
* What potential barriers do you foresee in implementing this approach, and how might you overcome them?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the lesson structure allow for the exploration and application of complex concepts?
* Were there any unexpected insights or challenges that emerged during the lesson?
* How can the lesson be improved to better meet the diverse needs of professional learners?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
