## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world case study of a public sector startup that successfully iterated its business model using Wardley Mapping insights. Facilitate a group discussion on the challenges and opportunities in public sector innovation.

**Learner Activities:** Analyze the case study in small groups, identifying key decision points and outcomes. Share insights with the larger group.

**Resources Used:** Case study presentation, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide additional context for those less familiar with public sector operations

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital whiteboard for collaborative note-taking during discussion

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide participants through the process of analyzing a sample Wardley Map for a fictional public sector startup. Demonstrate techniques for identifying areas of improvement and innovation opportunities.

**Learner Activities:** Work in pairs to analyze the sample Wardley Map, identifying potential areas for business model innovation. Document findings and share with other pairs.

**Resources Used:** Sample Wardley Map, analysis worksheet

**Differentiation:** Provide simplified maps for those new to Wardley Mapping, offer advanced analysis prompts for experienced participants

**Technology Integration:** Use Wardley Mapping software for interactive map exploration

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present the five-step process for iterating business models based on Wardley Map insights. Provide examples and best practices for each step, drawing from public sector experiences.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in brief discussions on each step of the process. Relate the concepts to their own professional experiences.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, process infographic

**Differentiation:** Offer additional examples for different types of public sector organizations

**Technology Integration:** Use an audience response system for real-time comprehension checks

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a hands-on workshop where participants apply the five-step process to a real or fictional public sector startup. Provide guidance and feedback throughout the activity.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, analyze a Wardley Map, identify areas for improvement, generate hypotheses, design experiments, and propose map and business model updates. Present findings to the class.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Map templates, hypothesis worksheets, experiment design guides

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within groups based on individual strengths and experience levels

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online tools for group work and presentations

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Lead a reflection session on the learning process and outcomes. Facilitate peer feedback on group presentations. Administer a summative assessment.

**Learner Activities:** Reflect on the application of Wardley Mapping to business model iteration. Provide constructive feedback to peers. Complete the summative assessment.

**Resources Used:** Reflection prompts, peer feedback forms, summative assessment

**Differentiation:** Offer choice in reflection format (written, verbal, or visual)

**Technology Integration:** Use online survey tools for summative assessment and feedback collection

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Assesses participants' ability to apply concepts in real-time, mirroring the iterative nature of the business model innovation process
* **Summative**: Case study analysis where participants must propose and justify business model iterations based on a given Wardley Map
  - Alignment: Evaluates participants' ability to synthesize all steps of the process and make strategic recommendations, similar to real-world decision-making scenarios

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice Wardley Mappers**: Provide simplified maps and step-by-step guides for analysis. Pair with more experienced participants during group work.
* **Experienced strategists**: Offer more complex scenarios and encourage them to mentor others. Provide additional resources for advanced techniques.
