## Assessment Methods
- {'type': 'Formative', 'description': 'Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions', 'alignment': "Assesses participants' ability to apply concepts in real-time, mirroring the iterative nature of the business model innovation process"}
- {'type': 'Summative', 'description': 'Case study analysis where participants must propose and justify business model iterations based on a given Wardley Map', 'alignment': "Evaluates participants' ability to synthesize all steps of the process and make strategic recommendations, similar to real-world decision-making scenarios"}

## Differentiation Strategies
- {'learner_group': 'Novice Wardley Mappers', 'strategies': 'Provide simplified maps and step-by-step guides for analysis. Pair with more experienced participants during group work.'}
- {'learner_group': 'Experienced strategists', 'strategies': 'Offer more complex scenarios and encourage them to mentor others. Provide additional resources for advanced techniques.'}

## Extension Activities
- Conduct a Wardley Mapping exercise for participants' own organizations
- Develop a 30-day plan for implementing business model iterations
- Create a case study of a successful business model iteration in their sector

## Additional Resources
- Simon Wardley's book 'Wardley Maps'
- Case studies of successful public sector innovations
