## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a case study of a failed government initiative due to misalignment with user needs. Facilitate a discussion on the importance of user-centric approaches in public sector strategy.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in discussion, sharing experiences of misaligned initiatives from their own work.

**Resources Used:** Case study presentation, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide multiple case studies to accommodate different areas of government

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital polling tool to gather initial thoughts on user-centric approaches

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through various user research methods. Demonstrate how to conduct a mock user interview and analyze results.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, practice different user research techniques. Conduct mock interviews and surveys.

**Resources Used:** User research templates, interview guides

**Differentiation:** Provide role-specific scenarios for different government departments

**Technology Integration:** Use online survey tools and virtual breakout rooms for group activities

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present the key components of identifying user needs and desired outcomes in the context of Wardley Mapping. Explain the process of prioritizing outcomes and aligning with government priorities.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions on how to apply concepts to their specific roles.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, example Wardley Maps

**Differentiation:** Provide additional reading materials for those wanting deeper understanding

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software with embedded quizzes

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through the process of creating user journeys and translating them into the beginnings of a Wardley Map. Provide feedback and support.

**Learner Activities:** Work in teams to create user journeys for a specific government service. Begin drafting a Wardley Map based on identified needs and outcomes.

**Resources Used:** User journey templates, Wardley Mapping software

**Differentiation:** Offer additional support for those new to Wardley Mapping

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative mapping tools for real-time teamwork

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate team presentations of their user journeys and draft Wardley Maps. Lead a peer feedback session.

**Learner Activities:** Present team work, provide constructive feedback to peers, reflect on learning and application to own work.

**Resources Used:** Presentation equipment, feedback rubrics

**Differentiation:** Allow for various presentation formats (e.g., verbal, visual, written)

**Technology Integration:** Use digital feedback tools for real-time peer assessment

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group activities and discussions throughout the lesson
  - Alignment: Assesses ongoing understanding and application of concepts
* **Summative**: Team presentation of user journeys and draft Wardley Maps
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to synthesize learning into practical application
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on applying the lesson to a specific work challenge
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to transfer learning to real-world professional contexts

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional guidance on Wardley Mapping basics, offer simplified templates
* **Experienced strategists**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage mentoring of less experienced peers
* **Policy-focused professionals**: Emphasize connections between user needs and policy development
* **Service delivery professionals**: Focus on translating user needs directly into service improvements

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Data analytics for understanding user behavior
* Change management for implementing user-centric strategies
* Behavioral economics in public policy design
* Digital transformation in government services

## Real-World Applications
* Redesigning citizen-facing government services
* Developing user-centric policies
* Improving inter-departmental collaboration based on shared user needs
* Allocating resources more effectively based on prioritized outcomes

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on personal biases in understanding user needs
* Analysis of how learner's role impacts their perspective on user needs
* Consideration of ethical implications in user research and strategy development

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a real user research project in learner's department
* Create a full Wardley Map for a specific government initiative
* Develop a proposal for a user-centric policy or service improvement

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure compliance with data protection regulations when discussing real user data
* Consider ethical implications of user research in vulnerable populations

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this lesson changed your approach to understanding user needs in your work?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing these methods in your organization?
* How can you advocate for more user-centric approaches in your role?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the activities engage learners from diverse government roles?
* What aspects of Wardley Mapping seemed most challenging for learners?
* How can the lesson be improved to better address the varied needs of public sector professionals?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use virtual whiteboard tools for collaborative mapping exercises
* Implement breakout rooms for small group discussions and activities
* Utilize asynchronous discussion forums for extended reflection and peer feedback
* Provide pre-recorded demonstrations of user research techniques

## Additional Resources
