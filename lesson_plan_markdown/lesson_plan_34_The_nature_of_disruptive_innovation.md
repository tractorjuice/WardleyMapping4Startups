## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a brief overview of a successful public sector digital transformation (e.g., GOV.UK). Pose thought-provoking questions about how this transformation might have been conceptualized and executed.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in a group discussion, sharing initial thoughts on the challenges and opportunities in public sector innovation.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, video clip of GOV.UK case study

**Differentiation:** Provide additional context for those less familiar with government digital services

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling software to gather and display learners' initial perspectives

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce Wardley Mapping concepts and guide learners through a basic mapping exercise using a simplified public service scenario.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, create a basic Wardley Map for the given scenario, identifying key components and their evolution.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping tutorial, scenario description handouts

**Differentiation:** Provide pre-made component cards for groups that need additional support

**Technology Integration:** Use online Wardley Mapping tools for digital creation and collaboration

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Deliver a presentation on the principles of disruptive innovation and how Wardley Mapping can be used to identify and analyze disruptive opportunities in the public sector.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions linking Wardley Mapping concepts to disruptive innovation theory.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, excerpts from 'Wardley Mapping for Startups' book

**Differentiation:** Provide a glossary of key terms for those new to the concepts

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital whiteboard for interactive concept mapping during the presentation

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a complex mapping exercise based on a real public sector challenge. Guide learners in identifying potential disruptive opportunities and strategies.

**Learner Activities:** In teams, create a detailed Wardley Map for the given challenge, analyze it for disruptive potential, and develop strategic recommendations.

**Resources Used:** Detailed case study materials, Wardley Mapping software or large format paper

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within teams based on individual strengths and experience levels

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative project management tools to organize team efforts and document strategies

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Moderate team presentations of their Wardley Maps and strategic recommendations. Provide constructive feedback and facilitate peer evaluation.

**Learner Activities:** Present team findings, engage in critical discussion of other teams' work, and reflect on the application of Wardley Mapping to their professional contexts.

**Resources Used:** Presentation equipment, evaluation rubrics

**Differentiation:** Offer multiple presentation formats (e.g., verbal, visual, written) to accommodate different communication preferences

**Technology Integration:** Use virtual reality or augmented reality tools to create immersive presentations of the Wardley Maps

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation and feedback during group mapping exercises
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts in real-time
* **Summative**: Team presentation of Wardley Map and disruptive innovation strategy
  - Alignment: Evaluates comprehensive understanding and application of key concepts to professional scenarios
* **Summative**: Individual reflection paper on applying Wardley Mapping to learner's specific work context
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to transfer learning to personal professional situations

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional scaffolding in mapping exercises, offer more structured templates for strategy development
* **Experienced innovation leaders**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage mentoring of less experienced team members, provide opportunities for deeper theoretical discussions

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Link to change management principles in organizational psychology
* Explore connections with data science and predictive analytics in identifying weak signals
* Discuss implications for public policy and governance studies

## Real-World Applications
* Analyzing potential for disruption in specific government services (e.g., healthcare, education, transportation)
* Developing innovation strategies for public sector startups
* Informing policy decisions related to technology adoption and digital transformation in government

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflective journaling on personal insights gained from the mapping process
* Group discussions on how Wardley Mapping challenges or reinforces existing mental models of innovation
* Self-assessment of skills developed and areas for further learning in disruptive innovation analysis

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a Wardley Mapping exercise for the learner's own organization or a client
* Develop a disruptive innovation proposal based on insights from Wardley Mapping
* Create a learning module to teach Wardley Mapping to colleagues

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions about potential disruptions in government services remain constructive and ethical
* Address data privacy and security concerns when discussing real-world applications

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How might Wardley Mapping change your approach to innovation in your professional role?
* What challenges do you anticipate in applying Wardley Mapping to your specific public sector context?
* How can you use the insights from this lesson to drive meaningful change in your organization?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the lesson engage learners with diverse professional backgrounds?
* What aspects of Wardley Mapping seemed to resonate most with the learners, and why?
* How can the lesson be improved to better address the specific challenges of public sector innovation?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
