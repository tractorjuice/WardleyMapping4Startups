## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world case study of a startup facing significant market uncertainties. Facilitate a discussion on the challenges of strategic planning in uncertain environments.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in group discussion, sharing experiences with strategic planning challenges in their own organizations.

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide additional context for learners less familiar with the industry in the case study

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital whiteboard for collaborative brainstorming of uncertainties and challenges

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through the process of creating a baseline Wardley Map for the case study. Introduce the concept of multi-map analysis and demonstrate how to create alternative scenarios.

**Learner Activities:** Work in small groups to create a baseline Wardley Map and identify key uncertainties that could lead to alternative futures.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping software, scenario planning worksheets

**Differentiation:** Provide templates with different levels of detail for learners with varying Wardley Mapping experience

**Technology Integration:** Use Wardley Mapping software to create and share maps in real-time

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present best practices for multi-map analysis, including techniques for creating difference maps and comparing scenarios. Discuss the balance between exploring multiple futures and maintaining focus.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions about multi-map analysis techniques.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, example multi-map analyses

**Differentiation:** Provide additional examples for learners who need more context

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software to demonstrate dynamic map comparisons

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a hands-on workshop where learners apply multi-map analysis to the case study. Provide guidance and feedback as needed.

**Learner Activities:** Create multiple Wardley Maps representing different future scenarios for the case study startup. Analyze and compare the maps to identify strategic implications.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping software, scenario analysis templates

**Differentiation:** Offer additional support or challenge questions based on learner progress

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative mapping tools to enable group work on scenario creation and analysis

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a process of presenting their multi-map analyses and discussing strategic insights. Facilitate peer feedback and reflection.

**Learner Activities:** Present multi-map analyses to peers, discuss strategic implications, and provide constructive feedback to other groups.

**Resources Used:** Presentation guidelines, peer feedback forms

**Differentiation:** Adjust presentation format based on learner preferences (e.g., formal presentations vs. informal discussions)

**Technology Integration:** Use virtual breakout rooms for small group presentations and discussions

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group work and discussions during the Explore and Elaborate phases
  - Alignment: Assesses learners' ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts and engage in strategic thinking
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final multi-map analysis presentations and strategic recommendations
  - Alignment: Assesses learners' ability to create, analyze, and derive insights from alternative future scenarios

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice Wardley Mappers**: Provide simplified templates, additional guidance on mapping techniques, and pair with more experienced learners
* **Experienced strategists**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage deeper analysis of strategic implications, and facilitate peer teaching opportunities

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Connect to financial modeling and forecasting
* Explore links with design thinking and innovation processes
* Discuss applications in project management and risk assessment

## Real-World Applications
* Use multi-map analysis for product development strategy
* Apply techniques to evaluate potential market expansions
* Utilize insights for investor pitches and board presentations

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflect on how multi-map analysis challenges or reinforces existing strategic thinking approaches
* Consider how the process of creating alternative scenarios impacts personal biases and assumptions
* Discuss how learners might integrate these techniques into their regular strategic planning processes

## Extension Activities
* Apply multi-map analysis to learners' own organizational contexts
* Develop a multi-map analysis presentation for executive leadership
* Create a guide for introducing multi-map analysis to cross-functional teams

## Safety Considerations
* Remind learners to respect confidentiality when discussing real-world examples
* Encourage a supportive environment for sharing ideas and giving feedback

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How does multi-map analysis change your approach to strategic planning?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing these techniques in your organization?
* How might you adapt these methods for different stakeholders or decision-making contexts?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the case study engage learners across different experience levels?
* What aspects of multi-map analysis seemed to resonate most with the group?
* How can the hands-on activities be refined to better simulate real-world strategic challenges?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use breakout rooms for small group activities and discussions
* Leverage virtual whiteboarding tools for collaborative mapping exercises
* Incorporate digital polling and quizzes for real-time engagement and assessment

## Additional Resources
* Simon Wardley's blog on advanced mapping techniques
* Case studies of startups using scenario planning effectively
* Academic papers on the intersection of Wardley Mapping and strategic foresight
