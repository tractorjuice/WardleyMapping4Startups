## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a complex startup scenario and ask participants to brainstorm strategic approaches. Introduce Wardley Mapping as a tool for visualizing and discussing strategy.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in initial brainstorming, share experiences with strategic discussions, and identify challenges in aligning stakeholders.

**Resources Used:** Startup scenario description, whiteboard for capturing ideas

**Differentiation:** Provide visual and verbal explanations of the scenario to accommodate different learning styles

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital whiteboard for remote participants to contribute ideas in real-time

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide participants through the basics of creating a Wardley Map, using the startup scenario as an example. Demonstrate how to identify components, map dependencies, and consider evolution.

**Learner Activities:** Create a basic Wardley Map for the given scenario, collaborating in small groups to discuss component placement and relationships.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping templates, guidance sheets on map creation

**Differentiation:** Provide pre-filled templates for those new to mapping, allow advanced participants to create more detailed maps

**Technology Integration:** Use a collaborative mapping tool like Miro or Figma for group work

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present advanced Wardley Mapping techniques for strategic discussions, including scenario exploration, identifying strategic options, and prioritization exercises. Share best practices for facilitating mapping sessions.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions about how these techniques can be applied in their own contexts.

**Resources Used:** Slide deck with examples of advanced mapping techniques, video clips of expert facilitators

**Differentiation:** Provide written summaries of key points for those who prefer reading, use visual aids for visual learners

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive polling to gauge understanding and tailor explanations

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a mock strategic discussion using Wardley Mapping, demonstrating techniques for engaging stakeholders, surfacing assumptions, and driving consensus. Provide coaching and feedback as participants practice facilitation.

**Learner Activities:** Take turns facilitating mini strategic discussions using Wardley Maps, applying techniques learned. Provide peer feedback and reflect on the experience.

**Resources Used:** Role cards for different stakeholder perspectives, facilitation tip sheets

**Differentiation:** Adjust complexity of discussion scenarios based on participant experience levels

**Technology Integration:** Use breakout rooms for small group practice sessions, with facilitator rotating to provide support

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide participants through a reflection process on the use of Wardley Mapping for strategic discussions. Facilitate a group discussion on how to implement these techniques in their organizations.

**Learner Activities:** Complete a self-assessment on their ability to facilitate strategic discussions using Wardley Mapping. Develop an action plan for implementing Wardley Mapping in their next strategic meeting.

**Resources Used:** Self-assessment rubric, action plan template

**Differentiation:** Offer choice in how to present action plans (written, verbal, or visual)

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital form for self-assessment submission and analysis

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of participation and skill application during mock facilitation sessions
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to apply Wardley Mapping techniques in realistic scenarios
* **Summative**: Creation and presentation of an action plan for implementing Wardley Mapping in strategic discussions
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to adapt learned techniques to specific organizational contexts

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice strategic planners**: Provide additional guidance on basic strategy concepts, offer simplified mapping templates
* **Experienced executives**: Challenge with complex scenarios, encourage sharing of personal experiences to enrich discussions

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project management for implementing strategic decisions
* Data analysis for informing map creation and evolution
* Change management for introducing Wardley Mapping to organizations

## Real-World Applications
* Quarterly strategy review meetings
* Product roadmap planning sessions
