## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world case study of a startup that failed due to misaligned strategy and market assumptions. Facilitate a brief discussion on potential causes and how better strategic tools might have helped.

**Learner Activities:** Analyze the case study in small groups, identifying key issues and discussing potential solutions.

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide case studies from various industries to allow participants to choose one relevant to their experience

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital polling tool to gather initial thoughts on the case study and display results in real-time

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce Wardley Mapping concepts and demonstrate how to create a basic map. Guide participants through the process of mapping their own startup or a provided scenario.

**Learner Activities:** Create initial Wardley Maps for their startup or assigned scenario, identifying key components, dependencies, and evolution stages.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping tutorial, mapping software or templates

**Differentiation:** Offer one-on-one guidance for those new to mapping; provide advanced challenges for experienced mappers

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative mapping software to allow real-time feedback and sharing of maps

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present the synergies between Wardley Mapping and Lean Startup, focusing on how maps can inform hypothesis generation and testing. Provide examples of how to derive strategic insights from maps.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in discussions about how to apply these concepts to their own projects.

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, example Wardley Maps with corresponding hypotheses

**Differentiation:** Use a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic explanations to cater to different learning styles

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software to allow participants to explore example maps and hypotheses

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide participants through the process of generating hypotheses based on their Wardley Maps, prioritizing them, and designing experiments to test critical assumptions.

**Learner Activities:** Work in small groups to identify key areas of uncertainty on their maps, generate strategic hypotheses, prioritize them, and design experiments to test the most critical assumptions.

**Resources Used:** Hypothesis generation templates, experiment design worksheets

**Differentiation:** Provide additional support or challenges based on participants' progress and experience levels

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative documents for hypothesis tracking and experiment design, allowing for easy sharing and feedback

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate group presentations of Wardley Maps, hypotheses, and experiment designs. Lead a discussion on how to interpret experiment results in the context of the overall map and strategy.

**Learner Activities:** Present their work to the larger group, provide peer feedback, and discuss potential next steps for their projects based on the insights gained.

**Resources Used:** Presentation tools, peer evaluation rubrics

**Differentiation:** Allow for various presentation formats (e.g., verbal, visual, written) to accommodate different strengths

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital feedback tool for real-time peer and facilitator evaluations

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during mapping and hypothesis generation activities
  - Alignment: Assesses participants' ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts and generate relevant hypotheses
* **Summative**: Final presentation of Wardley Map, strategic hypotheses, and experiment designs
  - Alignment: Evaluates participants' ability to synthesize learning into a coherent strategic approach for their startup

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice entrepreneurs**: Provide additional guidance on business model concepts and basic strategy principles; offer simplified templates for mapping and hypothesis generation
* **Experienced business leaders**: Encourage deeper analysis of industry trends and disruptive potential; challenge them to consider more complex scenarios and second-order effects

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Connect to systems thinking and complexity theory
* Explore applications in public policy and government innovation
* Discuss implications for corporate strategy and innovation management

## Real-World Applications
* Using Wardley Maps to identify potential disruptive threats or opportunities in an industry
* Applying the integrated approach to pivot decisions in early-stage startups
* Leveraging strategic context to design more effective growth experiments

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflect on how the Wardley Mapping process changes participants' understanding of their business landscape
* Discuss how the integrated approach might have altered past business decisions
* Consider how this strategic thinking can be applied to personal career development

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a real experiment based on the hypotheses generated during the workshop
* Create a more detailed Wardley Map for a specific product or service line
* Develop a strategic roadmap based on the insights from the Wardley Map and hypotheses

## Safety Considerations
* Remind participants to respect confidentiality when discussing real business strategies
* Encourage a supportive environment for sharing ideas and giving constructive feedback

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has this approach changed your thinking about your business strategy?
* What hidden assumptions did you uncover through the Wardley Mapping process?
* How might you integrate this approach into your regular strategic planning process?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did participants grasp the connection between Wardley Mapping and hypothesis testing?
* What aspects of the workshop seemed most valuable to participants?
* How can the workshop be improved to better meet the needs of different experience levels?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use breakout rooms for small group activities and discussions
* Leverage virtual whiteboarding tools for collaborative mapping exercises
* Incorporate more frequent check-ins and shorter activity durations to maintain engagement

## Additional Resources
* Simon Wardley's book 'Wardley Maps'
* Eric Ries' 'The Lean Startup'
* Online Wardley Mapping communities and forums for ongoing learning and support
