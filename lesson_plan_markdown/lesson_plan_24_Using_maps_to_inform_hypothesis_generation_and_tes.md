## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during mapping and hypothesis generation activities (Alignment: Assesses participants' ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts and generate relevant hypotheses)
* **Summative**: Final presentation of Wardley Map, strategic hypotheses, and experiment designs (Alignment: Evaluates participants' ability to synthesize learning into a coherent strategic approach for their startup)

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice entrepreneurs**: Provide additional guidance on business model concepts and basic strategy principles; offer simplified templates for mapping and hypothesis generation
* **Experienced business leaders**: Encourage deeper analysis of industry trends and disruptive potential; challenge them to consider more complex scenarios and second-order effects

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a real experiment based on the hypotheses generated during the workshop
* Create a more detailed Wardley Map for a specific product or service line
* Develop a strategic roadmap based on the insights from the Wardley Map and hypotheses

## Additional Resources
* Simon Wardley's book 'Wardley Maps'
* Eric Ries' 'The Lean Startup'
* Online Wardley Mapping communities and forums for ongoing learning and support
