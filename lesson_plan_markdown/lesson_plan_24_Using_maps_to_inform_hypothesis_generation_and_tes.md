## Assessment Methods
- {'type': 'Formative', 'description': 'Ongoing observation and feedback during mapping and hypothesis generation activities', 'alignment': "Assesses participants' ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts and generate relevant hypotheses"}
- {'type': 'Summative', 'description': 'Final presentation of Wardley Map, strategic hypotheses, and experiment designs', 'alignment': "Evaluates participants' ability to synthesize learning into a coherent strategic approach for their startup"}

## Differentiation Strategies
- {'learner_group': 'Novice entrepreneurs', 'strategies': 'Provide additional guidance on business model concepts and basic strategy principles; offer simplified templates for mapping and hypothesis generation'}
- {'learner_group': 'Experienced business leaders', 'strategies': 'Encourage deeper analysis of industry trends and disruptive potential; challenge them to consider more complex scenarios and second-order effects'}

## Extension Activities
- Conduct a real experiment based on the hypotheses generated during the workshop
- Create a more detailed Wardley Map for a specific product or service line
- Develop a strategic roadmap based on the insights from the Wardley Map and hypotheses

## Additional Resources
- Simon Wardley's book 'Wardley Maps'
- Eric Ries' 'The Lean Startup'
- Online Wardley Mapping communities and forums for ongoing learning and support
