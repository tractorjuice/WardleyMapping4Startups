**Resources Used:** Slide deck, visual aids illustrating component evolution

**Differentiation:** Provide additional examples for those struggling with the concepts, offer advanced readings for quick learners

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software with embedded quizzes and discussion prompts

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a case study analysis where participants apply their understanding of component evolution to a complex startup scenario. Guide discussions on strategies to avoid misinterpretation.

**Learner Activities:** Analyze the case study in groups, apply Wardley Mapping techniques to identify potential evolution misinterpretations, and develop strategies to address them.

**Resources Used:** Detailed case study materials, strategy development worksheets

**Differentiation:** Provide varying levels of complexity in case studies to match participant experience

**Technology Integration:** Use virtual breakout rooms for group discussions and collaborative document editing tools for strategy development

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Administer a summative assessment that requires participants to analyze a startup's Wardley Map and identify potential misinterpretations of component evolution.

**Learner Activities:** Complete the assessment individually, applying knowledge gained throughout the session.

**Resources Used:** Assessment sheets with Wardley Maps and related questions

**Differentiation:** Offer additional time or support for those who need it

**Technology Integration:** Use online assessment tools with immediate feedback capabilities

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Aligns with objectives related to analyzing and evaluating component evolution concepts
* **Summative**: Final assessment requiring analysis of a startup's Wardley Map and identification of potential misinterpretations
  - Alignment: Aligns with all learning objectives, particularly applying knowledge to real-world scenarios

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice startup founders**: Provide additional background on Wardley Mapping, offer simplified examples and more guided practice
* **Experienced strategists**: Present more complex scenarios, encourage peer teaching, and provide opportunities for deeper analysis
