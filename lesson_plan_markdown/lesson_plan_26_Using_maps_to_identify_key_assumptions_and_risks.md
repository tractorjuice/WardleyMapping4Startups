## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a case study of a failed startup that didn't identify critical assumptions. Facilitate a brief discussion on why identifying assumptions is crucial for startups.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in discussion, sharing personal experiences or known examples of startup failures due to unexamined assumptions.

**Resources Used:** Case study presentation, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide multiple case studies from various industries to cater to diverse professional backgrounds.

**Technology Integration:** Use an interactive polling tool to gather initial thoughts on common startup assumptions.

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce Wardley Mapping concepts and demonstrate how to create a basic map. Guide learners through the process of creating their own Wardley Map for a hypothetical startup.

**Learner Activities:** Create a Wardley Map for a given startup scenario, identifying components, positioning them on the map, and drawing connections.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping guide, sample maps, mapping software or templates

**Differentiation:** Provide additional support for those new to Wardley Mapping, offer advanced challenges for experienced mappers.

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online mapping tools for remote or hybrid learning environments.

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Explain the process of identifying assumptions and risks using Wardley Maps. Demonstrate the Assumption Mapping Workshop technique.

**Learner Activities:** Analyze their created maps to identify key assumptions about value chain, evolution, and positioning. List potential risks associated with these assumptions.

**Resources Used:** Assumption Mapping Workshop guide, risk identification checklist

**Differentiation:** Provide industry-specific examples to help learners connect concepts to their professional contexts.

**Technology Integration:** Use digital collaboration tools for group assumption mapping exercises.

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce lean startup principles and the Build-Measure-Learn cycle. Guide learners in designing experiments to test their identified assumptions.

**Learner Activities:** Design rapid experiments to validate or invalidate the top 3 critical assumptions identified in their Wardley Maps. Create a plan for implementing these experiments.

**Resources Used:** Lean Startup methodology guide, experiment design templates

**Differentiation:** Offer additional resources on advanced experimentation techniques for more experienced learners.

**Technology Integration:** Use project management tools to plan and track assumption testing experiments.

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a reflection session on the learning process and potential applications in learners' professional contexts.

**Learner Activities:** Present their Wardley Maps, identified assumptions, and experimental designs to peers for feedback. Reflect on how they can apply these techniques in their own startups or projects.

**Resources Used:** Peer evaluation rubric, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Allow for various presentation formats (e.g., verbal, visual, written) to accommodate different communication preferences.

**Technology Integration:** Use virtual breakout rooms for small group presentations and feedback sessions.

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of learner participation and engagement during mapping and assumption identification activities.
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to create and analyze Wardley Maps in real-time.
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final Wardley Maps, identified assumptions, and experimental designs.
  - Alignment: Assesses comprehensive understanding and application of key concepts to professional scenarios.

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice startup founders**: Provide additional guidance on basic business concepts and simplified Wardley Mapping templates.
* **Experienced business strategists**: Offer more complex scenarios and encourage deeper analysis of market dynamics and competitive positioning.

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project management for experiment design and execution
* Data analysis for interpreting experiment results
* Marketing for understanding customer needs and market positioning

## Real-World Applications
* Using Wardley Maps to guide strategic decision-making in startups
* Applying assumption testing to reduce risks in new product development
* Leveraging Wardley Mapping for competitive analysis and market positioning

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflect on personal biases and assumptions in business planning
* Analyze how Wardley Mapping changes their approach to strategic thinking
* Evaluate the effectiveness of their assumption identification and testing process

## Extension Activities
* Create a Wardley Map for their own startup or a project within their organization
* Conduct a full Assumption Mapping Workshop with their team
* Develop a long-term strategy for continuous assumption testing and business model refinement

## Safety Considerations
* Remind participants to respect confidentiality when discussing real business scenarios
* Encourage ethical considerations in experiment design and data collection

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has Wardley Mapping changed your perspective on your business model or strategy?
* What were the most surprising assumptions you uncovered during this process?
* How do you plan to integrate regular assumption testing into your work routine?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the learners grasp the concept of Wardley Mapping?
* Were the learners able to identify meaningful assumptions and risks?
* What aspects of the lesson could be improved to enhance learning outcomes?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use virtual whiteboarding tools for collaborative Wardley Mapping
* Implement breakout rooms for small group discussions and activities
* Utilize asynchronous discussion forums for extended reflection and peer feedback

## Additional Resources
* Simon Wardley's book 'Wardley Maps'
* Online Wardley Mapping communities and forums
* Case studies of successful startups using Wardley Mapping and lean methodologies
