**Technology Integration:** Use a collaborative digital whiteboard for group mapping exercises

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Elaborate on the key aspects of mapping components and their relationships. Demonstrate advanced techniques for visualizing value flow and component evolution.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and participate in guided discussions on applying concepts to their own startups.

**Resources Used:** Detailed Wardley Map examples, component evolution chart

**Differentiation:** Offer advanced concepts for experienced strategists, while reinforcing basics for novices

**Technology Integration:** Use animated slides to demonstrate the dynamic nature of component evolution

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a complex case study of a startup using Wardley Mapping. Facilitate a group analysis of the map and its strategic implications.

**Learner Activities:** Analyze the case study in groups, identifying key insights and potential strategic decisions based on the Wardley Map.

**Resources Used:** Detailed case study materials, analysis worksheet

**Differentiation:** Provide additional guiding questions for groups that need more support in analysis

**Technology Integration:** Use breakout rooms in virtual settings for small group discussions

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners in creating a Wardley Map for their own startup or a provided scenario. Provide feedback and facilitate peer review.

**Learner Activities:** Create a Wardley Map, present to peers, and engage in constructive critique and discussion.

**Resources Used:** Mapping tools (digital or physical), peer review rubric

**Differentiation:** Allow choice of mapping own startup or a provided scenario to accommodate different comfort levels

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing for virtual presentations of maps

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and mapping exercises throughout the session
  - Alignment: Assesses ongoing understanding and application of concepts in a collaborative setting
* **Summative**: Creation and presentation of a Wardley Map for learner's own startup or provided scenario
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts to real-world strategic planning challenges

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice startup founders**: Provide additional scaffolding in mapping exercises, offer simplified scenarios for practice
* **Experienced strategic planners**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage deeper analysis of evolutionary aspects

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Product management: Using maps to inform product roadmaps
* Marketing: Identifying unique value propositions through component analysis
* Finance: Prioritizing resource allocation based on component dependencies

## Real-World Applications
* Identifying critical dependencies in startup operations
* Anticipating market shifts and planning for future scenarios
* Informing strategic decisions on partnerships, product development, and resource allocation

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on how Wardley Mapping changes perspective on startup strategy
* Discussion on challenges faced during the mapping process and strategies to overcome them
* Consideration of how regular mapping practice could impact decision-making processes

## Extension Activities
* Create a series of Wardley Maps to track startup evolution over time
* Use Wardley Mapping in next strategic planning session with startup team
* Analyze a competitor's business model using Wardley Mapping techniques

## Safety Considerations
* Remind participants to maintain confidentiality when discussing specific startup details
* Encourage a supportive environment for sharing and critiquing ideas

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How does Wardley Mapping change your understanding of your startup's ecosystem?
* What potential strategic pivots or opportunities did you identify through this process?
* How might you integrate Wardley Mapping into your regular strategic planning processes?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did learners grasp the concept of component evolution?
* What aspects of Wardley Mapping seemed most challenging for participants?
* How can the lesson be adapted to better address the diverse needs of startup professionals?
