## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world scenario of a startup facing challenges in the public sector. Introduce the concept of Wardley Mapping and its potential to enhance the Build-Measure-Learn cycle.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in a group discussion about current challenges in their professional contexts and how they currently approach the Build-Measure-Learn cycle.

**Resources Used:** Slide presentation, discussion prompts

**Differentiation:** Provide multiple examples from different public sector domains to cater to diverse professional backgrounds.

**Technology Integration:** Use a digital polling tool to gather initial thoughts and experiences from learners.

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through the process of creating a basic Wardley Map for the scenario presented in the Engage phase.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, create a Wardley Map for the given scenario, identifying key components and their evolutionary stages.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping templates, online mapping tools

**Differentiation:** Provide additional support or advanced challenges based on learners' familiarity with mapping concepts.

**Technology Integration:** Utilize online Wardley Mapping tools for collaborative map creation.

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present the theoretical framework for integrating Wardley Mapping with the Build-Measure-Learn cycle. Highlight how each phase of the cycle is enhanced by mapping.

**Learner Activities:** Analyze and discuss how their created maps could inform each phase of the Build-Measure-Learn cycle for their scenario.

**Resources Used:** Slide presentation, example maps

**Differentiation:** Provide additional examples or one-on-one support for those needing clarification.

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing and annotation tools to highlight key concepts on example maps.

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a new case study of a successful integration of Wardley Mapping and Lean Startup in a public sector context. Facilitate a discussion on applying these concepts to learners' own professional challenges.

**Learner Activities:** Apply the integrated approach to a challenge from their own professional context. Create a plan for implementing this approach in their work.

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, planning templates

**Differentiation:** Offer different levels of complexity in case studies to match learners' experience levels.

**Technology Integration:** Use breakout rooms for small group discussions and collaborative planning.

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Assess learners' understanding through a combination of peer feedback and self-reflection.

**Learner Activities:** Present their implementation plans to peers for feedback. Complete a self-assessment on their understanding and planned application of the concepts.

**Resources Used:** Peer feedback rubrics, self-assessment questionnaires

**Differentiation:** Provide options for presentation format (verbal, written, visual) to accommodate different communication preferences.

**Technology Integration:** Use online forms for self-assessment and digital collaboration tools for peer feedback.

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and map creation process
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts in real-time
* **Formative**: Peer feedback on implementation plans
  - Alignment: Evaluates practical application of integrated approach in professional contexts
* **Summative**: Creation and presentation of an implementation plan
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to synthesize learning and apply it to real-world professional challenges
* **Summative**: Self-assessment questionnaire
  - Alignment: Encourages reflection on learning and planned application in professional role

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional scaffolding in Wardley Mapping concepts, offer simplified case studies
* **Experienced professionals**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage mentoring of less experienced peers
* **Learners from diverse public sector domains**: Provide domain-specific examples and encourage cross-domain knowledge sharing

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project management
* Public policy development
* Digital transformation in government
* Agile methodologies in non-tech sectors

## Real-World Applications
* Developing citizen-centric digital services
* Optimizing government procurement processes
* Innovating public transportation systems
* Enhancing public health initiatives through data-driven approaches

## Metacognition Opportunities
