**Technology Integration:** Use an interactive polling tool to gather initial thoughts and create word clouds of key concepts

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through the process of identifying components in a value chain using the case study. Introduce the Wardley Mapping tool.

**Learner Activities:** Work in small groups to identify and list value chain components for the case study startup. Begin plotting components on a basic Wardley Map.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping software, digital collaboration tools

**Differentiation:** Provide templates with pre-identified components for novice learners, challenge advanced learners to identify less obvious components

**Technology Integration:** Use breakout rooms in virtual settings for group work, utilize shared digital canvases for collaborative mapping

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present detailed explanations of value chain concepts, hierarchical structures, and evolution in Wardley Mapping. Provide examples relevant to GovTech.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and relate concepts to their own professional experiences. Refine their initial Wardley Maps based on new understanding.

**Resources Used:** Interactive presentation slides, video clips of expert explanations

**Differentiation:** Offer additional readings for those wanting deeper theoretical understanding, provide visual aids for visual learners

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software with embedded quizzes and real-time feedback

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a hands-on workshop where learners apply value chain analysis to their own startups or hypothetical GovTech scenarios.

**Learner Activities:** Create comprehensive Wardley Maps for their chosen scenarios, focusing on dependencies, evolution, and strategic implications.

**Resources Used:** Advanced Wardley Mapping tools, industry reports on GovTech trends

**Differentiation:** Provide coaching for those struggling with complex concepts, offer advanced scenarios for quick learners

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative mapping tools that allow for real-time feedback and iteration

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a peer review process of their Wardley Maps. Provide constructive feedback and facilitate group discussion on strategic insights.

**Learner Activities:** Present their Wardley Maps to peers, give and receive feedback, reflect on the strategic implications of their analysis.

**Resources Used:** Rubric for evaluating Wardley Maps, peer feedback forms

**Differentiation:** Allow for written or verbal presentations based on learner preference, provide additional time for those needing it

**Technology Integration:** Use digital portfolio tools for map submission and peer review process

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and map creation
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to apply concepts in real-time, mimicking the iterative nature of startup strategy development
* **Summative**: Final Wardley Map and strategic analysis presentation
  - Alignment: Evaluates comprehensive understanding and ability to synthesize insights for strategic decision-making in GovTech contexts

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice GovTech professionals**: Provide additional resources on government processes and regulations, offer more structured templates for Wardley Mapping
* **Experienced startup founders**: Challenge with complex scenarios involving multiple stakeholders, encourage deeper analysis of evolutionary aspects

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Public policy and governance
* Digital transformation in government
* Civic technology and citizen engagement
* Data privacy and security in public sector

## Real-World Applications
* Strategic planning for GovTech product development
* Identifying opportunities for public-private partnerships
* Navigating regulatory challenges in government innovation
* Optimizing resource allocation in resource-constrained public sector environments

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on how value chain analysis changes their perception of their startup's strategy
* Discussion on the challenges of applying traditional business tools to GovTech contexts
* Journaling on personal insights gained from the Wardley Mapping process

## Extension Activities
* Conduct a value chain analysis for a partner organization or government department
* Develop a presentation on value chain insights for potential investors or government stakeholders
* Create a blog post or article on value chain innovation in GovTech for a professional publication

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions about government processes respect confidentiality and security concerns
* Remind participants to use hypothetical or anonymized data when discussing sensitive information

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How has your understanding of your startup's value chain changed after this lesson?
* What potential innovations or pivots have you identified through the Wardley Mapping process?
* How might you apply value chain analysis to navigate regulatory challenges in your GovTech venture?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the lesson address the unique challenges of GovTech startups?
* What aspects of value chain analysis seemed most challenging for learners, and how might I address this in future sessions?
* How can I further integrate real-world GovTech scenarios to enhance the relevance of the lesson?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
