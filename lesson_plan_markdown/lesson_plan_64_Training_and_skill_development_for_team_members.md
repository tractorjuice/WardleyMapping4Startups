## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during mapping exercises and discussions (Alignment: Assesses participants' ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts in real-time)
* **Summative**: Evaluation of final Wardley Maps and implementation plans (Alignment: Measures participants' ability to create comprehensive maps and strategize implementation in their specific startup contexts)
* **Peer Assessment**: Structured peer feedback on presented implementation plans (Alignment: Encourages critical thinking and application of learned concepts to diverse startup scenarios)

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice Wardley Mappers**: Provide additional guided exercises, offer one-on-one support, use simplified mapping templates
* **Experienced Strategic Planners**: Offer advanced scenario planning challenges, encourage integration with existing strategic frameworks, facilitate discussions on complex multi-map analysis
* **Technical vs. Non-Technical Participants**: Provide industry-specific mapping examples, adjust complexity of technology components in mapping exercises

## Extension Activities
* Conducting a Wardley Mapping workshop with their own startup team
* Creating a series of evolving maps to track strategic changes over a 3-6 month period
* Participating in online Wardley Mapping communities and contributing to open-source mapping projects

## Additional Resources
* Simon Wardley's book: 'Wardley Maps: The Science of Strategy'
* Online Wardley Mapping tools and communities (e.g., OnlineWardleyMaps, MapScript)
* Case studies of successful Wardley Mapping implementations in startups
* Curated list of articles and videos on advanced Wardley Mapping techniques
