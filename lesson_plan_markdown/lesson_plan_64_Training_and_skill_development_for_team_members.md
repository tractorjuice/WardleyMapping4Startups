## Assessment Methods
- {'type': 'Formative', 'description': 'Ongoing observation and feedback during mapping exercises and discussions', 'alignment': "Assesses participants' ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts in real-time"}
- {'type': 'Summative', 'description': 'Evaluation of final Wardley Maps and implementation plans', 'alignment': "Measures participants' ability to create comprehensive maps and strategize implementation in their specific startup contexts"}
- {'type': 'Peer Assessment', 'description': 'Structured peer feedback on presented implementation plans', 'alignment': 'Encourages critical thinking and application of learned concepts to diverse startup scenarios'}

## Differentiation Strategies
- {'learner_group': 'Novice Wardley Mappers', 'strategies': 'Provide additional guided exercises, offer one-on-one support, use simplified mapping templates'}
- {'learner_group': 'Experienced Strategic Planners', 'strategies': 'Offer advanced scenario planning challenges, encourage integration with existing strategic frameworks, facilitate discussions on complex multi-map analysis'}
- {'learner_group': 'Technical vs. Non-Technical Participants', 'strategies': 'Provide industry-specific mapping examples, adjust complexity of technology components in mapping exercises'}

## Extension Activities
- Conducting a Wardley Mapping workshop with their own startup team
- Creating a series of evolving maps to track strategic changes over a 3-6 month period
- Participating in online Wardley Mapping communities and contributing to open-source mapping projects

## Additional Resources
- Simon Wardley's book: 'Wardley Maps: The Science of Strategy'
- Online Wardley Mapping tools and communities (e.g., OnlineWardleyMaps, MapScript)
- Case studies of successful Wardley Mapping implementations in startups
- Curated list of articles and videos on advanced Wardley Mapping techniques
