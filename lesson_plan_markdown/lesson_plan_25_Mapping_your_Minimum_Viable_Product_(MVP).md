## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a real-world scenario of a struggling public sector startup. Introduce the concept of Wardley Mapping and its potential to address the startup's challenges.

**Learner Activities:** Discuss in small groups the potential reasons for the startup's struggles and brainstorm initial solutions.

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, presentation slides

**Differentiation:** Provide additional context for those less familiar with public sector challenges

**Technology Integration:** Use an interactive polling tool to gather and display initial ideas

### Explore
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through the process of creating a basic Wardley Map for an MVP, using the case study as an example.

**Learner Activities:** In pairs, create a draft Wardley Map for the case study MVP using provided software or paper templates.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping software or paper templates, mapping guidelines

**Differentiation:** Offer simplified templates for novices and more complex scenarios for experienced professionals

**Technology Integration:** Utilize collaborative online mapping tools for remote or hybrid learning settings

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Provide a detailed explanation of Wardley Mapping components, evolution axis, and value chain representation. Demonstrate how to identify assumptions and risks using the map.

**Learner Activities:** Analyze their draft maps, identifying key assumptions and potential risks. Share findings with the larger group.

**Resources Used:** Expert-created Wardley Map examples, assumption identification checklist

**Differentiation:** Provide additional guidance and examples for those struggling with concept application

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing and annotation tools to highlight key map elements and patterns

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce strategies for rapid iteration based on Wardley Map insights. Facilitate a discussion on applying these strategies in the public sector context.

**Learner Activities:** In groups, develop an iteration plan for the case study MVP based on their Wardley Map analysis. Present and defend their plans to the class.

**Resources Used:** Rapid iteration strategy guide, public sector innovation case studies

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within groups based on individual strengths and experience levels

**Technology Integration:** Use virtual whiteboards for collaborative strategy development and presentation

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 15 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Administer a practical assessment where learners apply Wardley Mapping to a new public sector MVP scenario.

**Learner Activities:** Individually create a Wardley Map for a new scenario, identify key assumptions and risks, and propose an iteration strategy.

**Resources Used:** Assessment scenario, evaluation rubric

**Differentiation:** Offer varying levels of complexity in the assessment scenario

**Technology Integration:** Use an online assessment platform for submission and immediate feedback

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing observation and feedback during group activities and discussions
  - Alignment: Assesses application of concepts in real-time, mimicking professional collaborative environments
* **Summative**: Final practical assessment applying Wardley Mapping to a new public sector MVP scenario
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to independently apply learned skills to a realistic professional situation

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional guidance, simplified templates, and more structured activities
* **Experienced professionals**: Offer more complex scenarios, encourage peer mentoring, and provide opportunities for deeper analysis

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Project management in public sector
* Public policy development
* Digital transformation in government
* Civic technology innovation

## Real-World Applications
* Developing citizen-centric government services
* Optimizing resource allocation in public sector projects
* Navigating regulatory constraints in government innovation
* Improving public-private partnerships through strategic mapping

## Metacognition Opportunities
* Reflection on how Wardley Mapping changes their approach to MVP development
* Self-assessment of strengths and areas for improvement in strategic thinking
* Discussion on how this approach might be received in their current work environment

## Extension Activities
* Apply Wardley Mapping to a current work project and report back on insights gained
* Conduct a mini-workshop on Wardley Mapping for colleagues in their organization
* Develop a case study of successful Wardley Map application in their sector

## Safety Considerations
* Ensure discussions about public sector challenges remain constructive and ethical
* Maintain confidentiality when sharing real-world examples or experiences

## Reflection Questions
### For Learners
* How might Wardley Mapping change your approach to developing public sector MVPs?
* What challenges do you anticipate in implementing this approach in your organization?
* How can you use Wardley Mapping to better communicate your strategies to stakeholders?

### For Facilitator
* How effectively did the learners grasp the connection between Wardley Mapping and MVP development?
* What aspects of the lesson seemed most challenging for learners, and how can I address this in future sessions?
* How can I better incorporate real-world public sector examples in future iterations of this lesson?

## Adaptations for Virtual Learning
* Use breakout rooms for small group activities
* Employ collaborative online mapping tools for remote Wardley Map creation
* Utilize virtual whiteboards for group discussions and presentations
* Implement asynchronous discussion forums for extended reflection and peer feedback

## Additional Resources
