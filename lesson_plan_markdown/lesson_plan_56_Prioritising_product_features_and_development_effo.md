## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and Wardley Map creation during the Explore and Elaborate phases (Alignment: Assesses ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts in a collaborative setting)
* **Summative**: Individual mini-proposal for applying Wardley Mapping to a real or hypothetical product prioritization scenario (Alignment: Evaluates ability to synthesize learning and apply it to a professional context)

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice product managers**: Provide additional guidance on Wardley Mapping basics, offer simplified templates and scenarios
* **Experienced strategists**: Present more complex scenarios, encourage deeper analysis of strategic implications

## Extension Activities
* Apply Wardley Mapping to a current work project and document the process
* Create a presentation for colleagues on how to integrate Wardley Mapping into existing prioritization processes
* Analyze a competitor's product strategy using Wardley Mapping

## Additional Resources
* Simon Wardley's book 'Wardley Maps'
* Online Wardley Mapping communities and forums
* Case studies of successful product prioritization using Wardley Mapping
* Tutorials on advanced Wardley Mapping techniques
