### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide participants through the creation of a basic Wardley Map for a sample product ecosystem.

**Learner Activities:** Work in pairs to create a Wardley Map for the given product ecosystem, identifying key components and their evolutionary stages.

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping templates, sample product ecosystem description

**Differentiation:** Offer simplified templates for novices and more complex scenarios for experienced participants

**Technology Integration:** Utilize online Wardley Mapping tools for interactive map creation

### Explain
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present the key aspects of using Wardley Mapping for prioritization, including identifying core value propositions, assessing component evolution, and analyzing dependencies.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes and ask questions, relating the concepts to their own product experiences

**Resources Used:** Presentation slides, real-world examples

**Differentiation:** Provide additional examples for different industries or product types

**Technology Integration:** Use interactive presentation software for real-time polling and Q&A

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce a complex case study of a startup needing to prioritize its product roadmap. Facilitate group discussions and provide guidance as needed.

**Learner Activities:** In small groups, apply Wardley Mapping to the case study, create a prioritization strategy, and present findings to the class.

**Resources Used:** Case study materials, Wardley Mapping tools

**Differentiation:** Assign roles within groups based on experience levels

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative project management tools to organize and present strategies

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 45 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Lead a reflection session on the application of Wardley Mapping to prioritization. Introduce the final assessment task.

**Learner Activities:** Individually create a mini-proposal for applying Wardley Mapping to their own product or a hypothetical scenario.

**Resources Used:** Reflection prompts, assessment rubric

**Differentiation:** Offer choice in the complexity of the scenario for the final task

**Technology Integration:** Use digital portfolios for submitting and reviewing proposals

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Observation of group discussions and Wardley Map creation during the Explore and Elaborate phases
  - Alignment: Assesses ability to apply Wardley Mapping concepts in a collaborative setting
* **Summative**: Individual mini-proposal for applying Wardley Mapping to a real or hypothetical product prioritization scenario
  - Alignment: Evaluates ability to synthesize learning and apply it to a professional context

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice product managers**: Provide additional guidance on Wardley Mapping basics, offer simplified templates and scenarios
* **Experienced strategists**: Present more complex scenarios, encourage deeper analysis of strategic implications

## Cross-Disciplinary Connections
* Business strategy
* Market analysis
* Software development lifecycle
* User experience design

## Real-World Applications
