## Lesson Structure
### Engage
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present a brief case study of a successful value chain reconfiguration (e.g., Uber in transportation). Guide a discussion on how this disrupted the existing market.

**Learner Activities:** Participate in discussion, sharing personal experiences with disruptive innovations in their industries.

**Resources Used:** Slide deck with case study, whiteboard for capturing ideas

**Differentiation:** Provide multiple case studies from different industries to cater to diverse professional backgrounds

**Technology Integration:** Use an interactive polling tool to gather initial thoughts on disruptive innovation

### Explore
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Introduce Wardley Mapping concepts and guide learners through creating a basic map of their industry's value chain.

**Learner Activities:** Work in small groups to create Wardley Maps for their respective industries or sectors

**Resources Used:** Wardley Mapping software or large paper sheets, markers

**Differentiation:** Provide templates and examples for different industry types

**Technology Integration:** Use collaborative online mapping tools for virtual or hybrid sessions

### Explain
**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Present detailed strategies for value chain reconfiguration, including leveraging technology, disintermediation, and platform creation. Use the Wardley Map created earlier to illustrate concepts.

**Learner Activities:** Take notes, ask questions, and begin to identify potential reconfiguration opportunities on their own maps

**Resources Used:** Slide deck, annotated Wardley Maps

**Differentiation:** Provide additional reading materials for those wanting deeper theoretical understanding

**Technology Integration:** Use screen sharing and digital annotation tools to highlight key points on Wardley Maps

### Elaborate
**Duration:** 90 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Guide learners through a detailed exercise in reconfiguring a value chain. Provide feedback and facilitate group discussions.

**Learner Activities:** Apply learned concepts to redesign their industry's value chain, focusing on creating new market opportunities. Present ideas to peers for feedback.

**Resources Used:** Worksheets for value chain analysis, peer feedback forms

**Differentiation:** Offer additional support or challenge questions based on learner progress

**Technology Integration:** Use breakout rooms for small group discussions in virtual settings

### Evaluate
**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Facilitator Actions:** Facilitate a reflection session on the learning process and potential applications. Administer a summative assessment.

**Learner Activities:** Complete a summative assessment. Share key takeaways and action plans for applying concepts in their work.

**Resources Used:** Assessment tool, reflection prompts

**Differentiation:** Offer choice in assessment format (e.g., written plan, presentation, or prototype)

**Technology Integration:** Use online assessment tools with immediate feedback capabilities

## Assessment Methods
* **Formative**: Ongoing feedback on Wardley Maps and reconfiguration strategies during group work
  - Alignment: Aligns with objectives on analyzing value chains and designing strategies
* **Summative**: Development of a value chain reconfiguration proposal for learner's own industry or a provided case study
  - Alignment: Aligns with all learning objectives, requiring synthesis and application of concepts

## Differentiation Strategies
* **Novice professionals**: Provide additional scaffolding in Wardley Mapping techniques and value chain analysis
* **Experienced strategists**: Offer more complex scenarios and encourage deeper analysis of second-order effects
* **Public sector professionals**: Focus on government-specific examples and regulatory considerations in value chain reconfiguration
