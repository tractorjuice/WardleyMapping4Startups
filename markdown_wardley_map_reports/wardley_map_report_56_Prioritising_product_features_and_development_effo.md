## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the components and relationships involved in prioritizing product features for a startup. It spans from user needs to core product development, incorporating strategic elements like Wardley Mapping and innovation.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Needs', positioned at the top right of the map. This signifies that user needs are the primary driver for all other components and decisions in the product development process.

## Component Analysis

### User Needs

- **Position:** Visible (0.95) and Custom-built (0.79)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical starting point for all product decisions, highly visible but still requiring customization for each user segment.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Position:** Visible (0.85) and Product (0.70)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Key differentiator, translating user needs into tangible product offerings.

### Feature Prioritisation

- **Position:** Visible (0.65) and Custom-built (0.60)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical decision-making process, balancing user needs, strategic goals, and resource constraints.

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Concept (0.45) and Custom-built (0.40)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging strategic tool, providing valuable insights for feature prioritization and overall product strategy.

### Analytics Features

- **Position:** Concept (0.25) and Commodity (0.35)
- **Evolution Stage:** Commodity
- **Strategic Significance:** Evolving rapidly, crucial for data-driven decision making but becoming increasingly standardized.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a mix of components at different evolutionary stages, from concept-level analytics features to visible user needs. This diversity indicates a dynamic product development environment with opportunities for innovation and optimization.

### Key Evolving Components
