## Map Overview

This map illustrates the integration of Wardley Mapping with Lean Startup methodology, focusing on hypothesis generation and testing. It shows the evolution of the hypothesis testing process and how Wardley Mapping can enhance strategic decision-making in a startup context.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'Customer Needs', positioned at [0.75, 0.95]. This represents the ultimate focus of both Lean Startup and Wardley Mapping approaches, emphasizing that all activities should be driven by and validated against real customer needs.

## Component Analysis

### Hypothesis Generation

- **Position:** [0.25, 0.85] - High visibility, low evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis/Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical starting point for the Lean Startup process, heavily influenced by customer needs and market dynamics

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** [0.60, 0.40] - Mid visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Rental
- **Strategic Significance:** Key strategic tool that informs multiple aspects of the hypothesis testing process, from context to competitive landscape

### Lean Startup Methodology

- **Position:** [0.70, 0.70] - High visibility, high evolution
- **Evolution Stage:** Product/Rental
- **Strategic Significance:** Overarching framework that guides the entire hypothesis testing process

## Evolution Analysis
