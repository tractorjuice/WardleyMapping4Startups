## Map Overview

This Wardley Map provides an overview of the public sector startup ecosystem, highlighting the relationships between government services, regulatory environment, innovation opportunities, and various strategic tools and methodologies.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'User Needs', positioned at the top right of the map. This signifies that meeting citizen needs is the ultimate goal and driver of value in this ecosystem.

## Component Analysis

### Government Services

- **Position:** High value, relatively evolved
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+rental)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core offering that directly addresses user needs, critical for public sector startups to understand and integrate with

### GovTech Startups

- **Position:** Medium value, custom-built
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Key players in driving innovation and new solutions in the public sector

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Low value, genesis
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Emerging strategic tool for understanding and navigating the complex public sector landscape

### AI and Machine Learning
