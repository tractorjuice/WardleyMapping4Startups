## Map Overview

This Wardley Map illustrates the iteration process for public sector startups, showing the journey from identifying customer needs to iterating on the business model.

**Anchor:** The anchor is 'Customer Needs', positioned at [0.95, 0.85]. This represents the fundamental driver for all subsequent activities and innovations in the public sector startup ecosystem.

## Component Analysis

### Customer Needs

- **Position:** Positioned at [0.95, 0.85], indicating high visibility and maturity.
- **Evolution Stage:** Fully evolved (Product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical starting point for all value creation; drives the entire process.

### Value Proposition

- **Position:** Located at [0.80, 0.75], showing high visibility but slightly less maturity than Customer Needs.
- **Evolution Stage:** Late Product stage
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for translating customer needs into actionable business concepts.

### Business Model

- **Position:** Initially at [0.70, 0.65], evolving to 0.85 on the y-axis.
- **Evolution Stage:** Rapidly evolving from Custom-Built towards Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Central to the startup's ability to create and capture value; key focus of iteration.

### Wardley Map

- **Position:** Starting at [0.60, 0.55], evolving to 0.75 on the y-axis.
- **Evolution Stage:** Moving from Custom-Built towards Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical tool for visualizing and analyzing the business landscape.

### Analysis

- **Position:** Initially at [0.50, 0.45], evolving to 0.65 on the y-axis.
- **Evolution Stage:** Transitioning from Custom-Built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for deriving insights from the Wardley Map and informing strategy.

### Hypotheses

- **Position:** Starting at [0.40, 0.35], evolving to 0.55 on the y-axis.
- **Evolution Stage:** Moving from Genesis towards Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Crucial for formulating testable assumptions about the business model.

### Testing

- **Position:** Initially at [0.30, 0.25], evolving to 0.45 on the y-axis.
- **Evolution Stage:** Transitioning from Genesis to Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical for validating hypotheses and informing iterations.

### Validation

- **Position:** Starting at [0.20, 0.15], evolving to 0.35 on the y-axis.
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Genesis, moving towards Custom-Built
- **Strategic Significance:** Essential for confirming or refuting hypotheses and guiding further iteration.

### Iteration

- **Position:** Initially at [0.10, 0.05], evolving to 0.25 on the y-axis.
- **Evolution Stage:** Early Genesis, showing rapid evolution
- **Strategic Significance:** Core to the entire process, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation.
