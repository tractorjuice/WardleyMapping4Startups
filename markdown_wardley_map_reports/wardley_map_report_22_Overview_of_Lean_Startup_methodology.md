- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical starting point for all strategic decisions and product development efforts

### Lean Startup Process

- **Position:** Visible (0.60) and Product (0.60)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built to Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Core methodology driving the iterative development and learning process

### Wardley Mapping

- **Position:** Low Visibility (0.30) and Custom-built (0.30)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built
- **Strategic Significance:** Provides strategic context and evolutionary understanding to enhance Lean Startup decisions

### Long-term Vision

- **Position:** Low Visibility (0.10) and Product (0.35)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product
- **Strategic Significance:** Guides overall direction while allowing for pivots based on validated learning

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a progression from highly visible, custom-built components (Customer Needs) through various stages of product development and strategic planning, down to more commoditized tools and methodologies.
