- **Evolution Stage:** Commodity/Utility
- **Strategic Significance:** Key customer segment, driving demand for both pre and post-pivot offerings

### Document Management

- **Position:** Middle right (0.75, 0.35)
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+0.85)
- **Strategic Significance:** Former core offering, now less strategically important post-pivot

### System Integration

- **Position:** Middle (0.55, 0.45)
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-Built (+0.65)
- **Strategic Significance:** New core offering, addressing a critical market need for local councils

### Smart City Platform

- **Position:** Bottom left (0.25, 0.75)
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis (+0.35)
- **Strategic Significance:** Potential future direction, aligning with broader smart city trends

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a strategic shift from more commoditized offerings (document management) to custom solutions (system integration), aligning with evolving market needs.

### Key Evolving Components
- System Integration
- Data Analytics
- Decision Support

### Disruption Risks
- Legacy Systems
- Document Management

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from Local Councils through Startup X's offerings (pre and post-pivot) to various technical components. The pivot shifts focus from document management to system integration, incorporating more components in the value chain.

### Critical Paths
- Local Councils -> Post-Pivot Offering -> System Integration -> Legacy Systems
- Local Councils -> Post-Pivot Offering -> System Integration -> Cloud Infrastructure

### Bottlenecks
- Legacy Systems integration
- Transition from Document Management to System Integration

## Strategic Positioning

The pivot repositions Startup X from a product-focused offering (document management) to a more custom, integrated solution. This shift moves them closer to the customer's core needs and differentiates their offering in a more valuable space.

### Misalignments
- Potential overlap between pre and post-pivot offerings during transition
- Underutilization of Data Analytics and Decision Support in current positioning
