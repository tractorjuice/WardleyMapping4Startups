## Map Overview

This map illustrates the components and relationships involved in using Wardley Mapping to facilitate strategic discussions with stakeholders. It shows a value chain from high-level stakeholders down to competitive advantage, with various techniques and elements of the strategic discussion process mapped out.

**Anchor:** The anchor (user need) is 'Stakeholders', positioned at the top of the map. This signifies that the entire process is driven by the need to engage and align stakeholders in strategic discussions.

## Component Analysis

### Stakeholders

- **Position:** Top right, visible
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (+custom)
- **Strategic Significance:** Critical starting point for strategic discussions, representing the key decision-makers and influencers.

### Strategic Discussions

- **Position:** High visibility, custom-built
- **Evolution Stage:** Product (evolving rapidly)
- **Strategic Significance:** Core process for aligning stakeholders and driving strategic decision-making.

### Wardley Maps

- **Position:** Middle, moving towards product
- **Evolution Stage:** Custom-built (evolving to product)
- **Strategic Significance:** Key tool for visualizing and analyzing the business landscape and strategic options.

### Competitive Advantage

- **Position:** Bottom left, genesis
- **Evolution Stage:** Genesis
- **Strategic Significance:** Ultimate goal of the strategic discussion process, representing unique value creation.

## Evolution Analysis

The map shows a spectrum of evolution stages, from genesis (Competitive Advantage) to custom-built (Strategic Discussions) to product (Stakeholders). This indicates a maturing process of strategic facilitation using Wardley Mapping.

### Key Evolving Components
- Strategic Discussions
- Wardley Maps

### Disruption Risks
- Assumptions and Biases
- Strategic Options

## Value Chain Analysis

Value flows from Stakeholders through Strategic Discussions, leveraging Wardley Maps to understand the Business Landscape, challenge Assumptions and Biases, generate Strategic Options, inform Resource Allocation, and ultimately create Competitive Advantage.

### Critical Paths
- Stakeholders -> Strategic Discussions -> Wardley Maps -> Business Landscape -> Strategic Options

### Bottlenecks
- Assumptions and Biases
- Interactive Mapping Sessions

## Strategic Positioning
